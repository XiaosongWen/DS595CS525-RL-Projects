    Monte-Carlo
    In this problem, you will implememnt an AI player for Blackjack.
    The main goal of this problem is to get familar with Monte-Carlo algorithm.
    You could test the correctness of your code 
    by typing 'nosetests -v mc_test.py' in the terminal.
    
    You don't have to follow the comments to write your code. They are provided
    as hints in case you need.
